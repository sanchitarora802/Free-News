MERN 

##Basic Info
This project was created using basic HTML,CSS, React JS,Express JS and little bit of bootstrap 4.

##Description
This project provides you with all sort of news from all over the world with just one API call.
It helped me in learning how a API call is made and how to handle the response and play with it.
I have also added dark mode functionality to play around with the CSS and make it interesting.

##Working
Step 1: npm init 
Step 2: npm start
